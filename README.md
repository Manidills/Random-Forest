# Random-Forest

Buliding the multiple DT using the algorithms like-
  1. Information gain
  2. Gini index
  3. other DS algorithms

Random Forest works based on the voting method and it works well on both Regression and Classification

Ensemble Method-
  Divide and conquer method
  
Code-
1. Load diabetes and digits dataset from sklearn
2. check null and spilt into train and test
3. fit the model
4. check the metrics

Basically, RF is the combination of multiple DT and based on the voting method it select the values.
